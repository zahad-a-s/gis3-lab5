## Description
R _shiny_ application which displays table of Chicago roads by average daily traffic volume with corresponding map (currently unavailable).

## Use
This application uses a slider for the user to input a minimum average daily traffic volume, and the table of all roads is filtered using this minimum. 

## Data Sources
Code is largely based on the _shiny_ template in RStudio.

The map in the output is from OpenStreetMap, a free and open-source collaborative mapping project.

Data is taken from the [City of Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Average-Daily-Traffic-Counts/pfsx-4n4m), and is neither created nor owned by the author.
